# NAAMII-assignment

The assignment was completed using a notebook on kaggle. To run the code, first:
1. Clone the repo using `git clone`
2. Download the dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria) 
3. Extract the downloaded dataset into the project folder
4. Change the `path` variable inside the `.ipynb` file to point to full path of `cell_images` folder\
5. Change the `save_path` variable inside the `.ipynb` file to any location where you require output plots to be saved.

Then, run the code blocks one by one.

The notebook is also publicly available at kaggle for easy execution: https://www.kaggle.com/prashantshrestha78/naamii-assignment-prashant
