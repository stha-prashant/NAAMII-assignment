# NAAMII-assignment

The assignment was completed using a notebook on kaggle. To run the code, first:
1. Clone the repo using `git clone`
2. Download the dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria) 
3. Extract the downloaded dataset into the project folder
4. Change the `path` variable inside the `.ipynb` file to point to full path of `cell_images` folder\
5. Change the `save_path` variable inside the `.ipynb` file to any location where you require output plots to be saved.

Then, run the code blocks one by one.
A copy of the notebook is also available on kaggle for easy execution: [notebook link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/prashantshrestha78/naamii-assignment-prashant)
